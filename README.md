### Windows
Tested on Windows 10. It should work out of the box. Just double click the "XXXX.exe" file. If you are using antivirus such as Windows Defender it will show warning - you can safely click "More info" and choose "Run anyway". Next time it should run without warning.

### MacOS
Tested on Catalina OS. On MacOs you need to allow installation from unknown sources. Open the Apple menu > System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General tab. Under Allow apps downloaded from select App Store and identified developers. To launch the app simply Ctrl-click on its icon > Open.

Tested on Ubuntu 64bit. You can always run the app from the terminal. If using GUI and the app does not run when you double click the "XXXX" file icon you need to change the settings of your file explorer. In Nautilus file explorer click the hamburger menu (three lines icon next to minimise icon ), select "preferences". Click on "behaviour" tab, in the "Executable Text Files" option select "Run them".
